# Responsively Designed Portfolio

## A personal portfolio website with an about page, a contact page, and a projects page. 

This project exists because I wanted to create a portfolio for myself that was responsively designed, so that the application would render well on different devices with different screen sizes. As such, I familiarized myself with Bootstrap, which is a mobile-first toolkit. This was my first time using Bootstrap, and I made use of its grid, navbar, form, and image stylings. 

In the future, I plan to update this website with project links on the "portfolio" page. I also plan on making the contact form functional; currently, it is not. 

## Usage/Installation

To view the website, follow the link on the repository page; otherwise, you can [click here](https://meganjacobs97.github.io/responsively-designed-portfolio/index.html). 

In order to see the mobile responsiveness of the site, you have a couple options: 
* Resize your browser window. 
* View on your mobile device. 
* Use Google Chrome's [DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) by right-clicking and selecting "inspect." From there, you can toggle the device toolbar and then switch the view to different devices. 

To edit the code for yourself, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
